// Anonymous Credentials with Selective Attribute Revelation
//
// I'm not certain the use case below is the one intended.
//
// 1. The (credential) issuer generates a key pair with knowledge of
//    the number of attributes. The number of attributes is either set by
//    the nature of the deal to be made (e.g. a standard form) or the
//    user's choice.
// 2. The user generates keys using the issuer's public key.
// 3. The user supplies attribute values and their newly generated public
//    key to the issuer. Or maybe the issuer already knows the attribute
//    values?
// 4. The issuer signs the attributes with the issuer's secret key
//    and the user's public key. This is the issuer's attestation that
//    the user has committed to the attribute values.
// 5. The user presents to the prover (second party) the issuer
//    attestation signature as proof the user has committed to certain
//    attributes.
// 6. Possibly immediately, possibly later, the user generates and presents a
//    "reveal signature" that makes it possible to prove the user committed
//    to the to-be revealed values without revealing the values.
// 8. The user reveals the attribute values to the prover.
// ?. Something happens to commit the prover to something?
// 9. Finally, the prover has sufficient information to prove the user
//    did in fact commit to the attributes as revealed.
//
// Trust Issues
//
// The issuer (specifically, the credential issuer) must be trusted
// regarding their standing and their discression regarding keeping
// the attribute values confidential. How does the issuer know the
// user isn't lying about the attribute values? Maybe the issuer would
// only participate under certain conditions.
//
// The user must trust the issuer not to prematurely reveal the
// attributes or alter the attributes. Maybe the credential issuer has
// limited knowledge of the account requesting attestation or the
// pending transaction? If there were a small number of bidders
// perhaps the second party could infer something. Maybe the issuer
// wouldn't know with whom to conspire?
//
// How does the prover know these attributes are germane? Could the user
// game the system by getting the issuer to sign one set of attributes
// and later claim they were another set of attributes, i.e. changing
// the column headings?
//
// The only thing the prover knows is that the values were committed.
// The prover must also trust the issuer. Maybe reputation give the
// issuer incentive to be trustworthy. This is all that prevents the
// user from lying about the attribute values.
//
// Note: there were minor changes to what was exposed in the Zei
// interface needed to make the code below work outsize of Zei.
//    algebra/mod.rs: Made bn and groups public. Previously pub(crate).
//    src/lib.rs: Made algebra public. Was private.
